    <h2>What is TinkerHub?</h2>
    <p><i>TinkerHub is a community-driven platform that helps students grow in tech through peer learning, events, and projects.</i></p>
    <p>TinkerHub started as a student community at CUSAT and grow to a Nonprofit Foundation with a full-time team expanding across Kerala over the last 8 years.
      Thus by equipping individuals with future technologies, the foundation aims at creating a potent workforce, capable of unlocking the vast reservoir of untapped potential, in the form of creativity and innovation that the youth of the 21st century holds. The choice is the greatest luxury one can have; and to exercise that, it is only imperative that we arm each and every student with the right options to choose from. By improving specific learning outcomes, Tinkerhub essentially places People First by empowering these individuals with technology education and skill sets, to make sustainable choices and multi-dimensional solutions, that the complex new world needs. Thus, by arming them with the potent tools, through an inclusive culture, and problem-solving environment and imbibing the values of “technology for good”, Tinkerhub is trying to create a better, equal, and more sustainable world.
